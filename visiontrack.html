                            In order to determine the dynamics of emergent behavior systems, 
                            accurate vision tracking is required to analyze the state of each part 
                            and its components. I developed vision tracking algorithms for various 
                            emergent behavior systems, primarily for these “smarticle” robots. 
                            This algorithm was able to track each part over time as accurately as 
                            visually possible, even with an extremely low frame rate of 30fps.

            <h5>Background</h5>
            <p>
                “Smarticle” robots were previously developed by researchers in 
                Northwestern and Georgia Tech as an emergent behavior system. 
                Several can be placed in a ring at once to form a “supersmarticle”, which 
                allows for collective motion. 
                We can use factors such as sensed light or even sound to simply vary 
                their activation levels to help move the supersmarticle in a specific 
                direction, e.g. to follow a light source, like in the picture below. 
                Check out a paper about smarticles <a href="https://robotics.sciencemag.org/content/4/34/eaax4316" target="_blank">

            <p>Previously, the team used commercial trackers (OptiTrack), but needed a more accurate, 
                2-D vision tracking system. Additionally, servo motor angle information 
                couldn’t be found accurately from the electronics alone.</p>
