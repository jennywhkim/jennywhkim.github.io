                            As part of my design capstone, I am working in a team of students with an organic farm 
                            co-op of 80+ rice farmers in Thailand to help develop a custom fertilizer applicator for a 
                            UV-sensitive, aerobic fertilizer they are using. We are currently working on a prototype that can be 
                            attached to a tractor for efficiency and ease of use.

            <h5>Background</h5>
            <p>
                Raitong Organics Farm in Sisaket, Thailand has been seeking assistance in reimagining their fertilizing 
                process. Raitong is a leading organic farm in its area. Yet, they continue to struggle with an effective 
                solution for their fertilizer application process. Currently, aging farmers carry heavy backpacks full of 
                the organic fertilizer solution and can only apply during the night. Applying at night puts the farmers at risk 
                of snakes and other dangers.
            </p>
            
            <h5>Design Direction</h5>
            <p>
                Currently, Raitong uses a tractor attachment to carry out all of its other planting processes. To prevent 
                having to go through the path with the tractor a second after fertilizing the seeds, our team decided to 
                develop a design to be added to the tractor attachment. As the fertilizing needs to occur immediately after planting 
                from the seedboxes but before rolling out the soil, we will be clamping our mechanism to the frame between the two 
                steps of the attachment, which is shown below.

                Additionally, since this is an aerobic mixture which can only last up to 1-2 hours after being aerated, we are 
                incorporating an aerating mechanism to the tank, which we hope to use an aquarium air pump for. In order to make it easy to 
                maintain in a rural area, our group is exploring designs to keep the dispensing mechanism low-tech, such as dripper nozzles.
