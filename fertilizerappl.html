                            As part of my design capstone, I am working in a team of students with an organic farm 
                            co-op of 80+ rice farmers in Thailand to help develop a custom fertilizer applicator for a 
                            UV-sensitive, aerobic fertilizer they are using. We are currently working on a prototype that can be 
                            attached to a tractor for efficiency and ease of use.

            <h5>Fertilizer Application Issue</h5>
            <p>
                Raitong Organics Farm in Sisaket, Thailand has been seeking assistance in reimagining their fertilizing 
                process. Raitong is a leading organic farm in its area. Yet, they continue to struggle with an effective 
                solution for their fertilizer application process. Currently, aging farmers carry heavy backpacks full of 
                the organic fertilizer solution and can only apply during the night. Applying at night puts the farmers at risk 
                of snakes and other dangers.
            </p>
            <h5>Design Concept</h5>
            <p>
                Currently, Raitong uses a tractor attachment to carry out all of its other planting processes. The tractor goes 
                through the plot once to seed. Then, farmers go through the plot again at night to fertilize the seeds, and the tractor 
                has to go through once again to roll out the soil. To simplify the process, our team decided to 
                develop a design to be added to the tractor attachment, so that all three steps could be completed at once. As the 
                fertilizing needs to occur immediately after planting from the seedboxes but before rolling out the soil, we will be clamping 
                our mechanism to the frame between the two steps of the attachment, like in the sketch below.
            </p>

            <p>
                Additionally, since this is an aerobic mixture which can only last up to 1-2 hours after being aerated, we are 
                incorporating an aerating mechanism to the tank, which we hope to use an aquarium air pump for. In order to make it easy to 
                maintain in a rural area, our group explored designs to keep the dispensing mechanism low-tech. Below is our first proof-of-concept 
                mockup, where we attached dripper nozzles throughout the length of the attachment mockup.

            <h5>Key Subsystems</h5>
            <h6>Nozzles</h6>
            <p>
                Through further conversations with our client, precision became an important consideration. The fertilizer had 
                to land directly on top of the seeds, rather than just in the soil. This meant switching from dripping nozzles to spraying nozzles, 
                which would give a more consistent coverage throughout the length of the attachment. We found that there were dripping nozzles that could 
                screw into a threaded PVC pipe, or simply quick-connect to a flexible tube. Furthermore, although we were worried about supplying a 
                pressure high enough for spraying nozzles, we found many that would work with a pressure equivalent to that from a garden hose. We are currently 
                testing such nozzles to observe flow rate and whether it could match our specifications.
            </p>
            <img src="prjmedia/nozzle.jpg">
            <h6>Electric Pump</h6>
            <p>
                In order to supply a certain pressure for the nozzles, we determined that we needed a pump, either PTO (power take-off) or electric. While 
                PTO pumps were very common, we found through research that PTO pumps had more complications. PTO pumps may slow down together with the speed of 
                the tractor, and using one could potentially be dangerous given the high torque. Additionally, the pressure that PTO pumps provided would be too high for our 
                use and could potentially blow the seeds off the ground. We found a number of electric pumps for a 12V tractor battery, and of a variety of 
                pressures within our specifications.
            </p>
            <h6>Piping</h6>
            <p>
                The next question was whether our piping was to be rigid or flexible. A rigid pipe was initially desirable as it would prevent twisting and would keep all nozzles pointing 
                straight down. However, we later got an image from our client that showed a large chain in the middle, where we planned to put the pipe. 
                A flexible tube was later chosen to avoid the chain, but still allow for that even lateral coverage. This also greatly simplified our design for the attachment, since 
                we could easily use hose clamps.
            </p>

            <h5>Current Progress</h5>
            <p>
                As we are approaching the final weeks of our design process, we are working on using our calculations and testing data to select 
                the specific type of piping, tank, and pump we will need. Although we began the project hoping to deliver the full prototype to Raitong Organics 
                Farm, we have shifted to preparing a detailed roadmap for our client to follow instead, given the pandemic, and sending any products that may not be easily 
                found in Thailand.
