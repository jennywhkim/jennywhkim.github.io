                            As part of my mechanical engineering capstone, I'm working in a team of 
                            undergraduate and graduate students to design and build a robot that can perform 
                            skateboarding tricks on a half-pipe. I have been working on the mechanical 
                            design and the power-level systems of the robot. Currently, we are wrapping 
                            up the design of the robot and entering the building phase.

            <h5>Background</h5>
            <p>
                “Smarticle” robots were previously developed by researchers in 
                Northwestern and Georgia Tech as an emergent behavior system. 
                Several can be placed in a ring at once to form a “supersmarticle”, which 
                allows for collective motion. 
                We can use factors such as sensed light or even sound to simply vary 
                their activation levels to help move the supersmarticle in a specific 
                direction, e.g. to follow a light source, like in the picture below. 
                Check out a paper about smarticles <a href="https://robotics.sciencemag.org/content/4/34/eaax4316" target="_blank">
                    here</a>.<br>
            </p>

            <p>Previously, the team used commercial trackers (OptiTrack), but needed a more accurate, 
                2-D vision tracking system. Additionally, servo motor angle information 
                couldn’t be found accurately from the electronics alone.
            </p>
            <h5>Requirements</h5>
            <p>We needed a vision tracker that found:
                <ul>
                    <li>The position of each smarticle</li>
                    <li>The orientation of each smarticle</li>
                    <li>Servo angle for each arm</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h5>Experimental Setup</h5>
            <p>Because the shape of each smarticle was so symmetrical, I used color-coded stickers 
                placed strategically to gather information about the position, orientation, and the 
                servo angle for each arm. Colors were also used to discern between each smarticle. 
                A black foamcore board was used to minimize incorrect detection of reflected colors, 
                and a lot of modifications were made to the lighting to prevent glare, which would 
                lead to dropouts in data.
            </p>
            <img src="prjmedia/smrt1.jpg">
            <h5>Tracking Algorithm</h5>
            <p>
                    I had made a frame-to-frame stitching algorithm specifically for tracking 
                    of synthetic cells (another emergent behavior system). However, I could not 
                    use the algorithm or a Kalman filter because of 1. the jerkiness of the 
                    movements, 2. the low fps, and 3. certain orientations in which it was difficult 
                    to assign arms to a certain robot. Therefore, the tracking algorithm used circle 
                    detection on OpenCV to detect the sizes and colors of the dots. In particular, 
                    circles larger than a certain diameter indicated the position of the smarticle. 
                    The smaller circles, depending on the color and distance from the center, 
                    indicated arms or the orientation marker for the robot. Circle detection also 
                    allowed for tracking of the supersmarticle ring, to verify that the system was 
                    moving in the desired direction.<br>
                    <br>
                    The picture below illustrates the specific calculations performed. First the 
                    orientation vector was found. Then the orientation vector was used to find joint 
                    locations, then finally distance and an HSV color mask was used to find 
                    the angles of the servos.
            </p>

            <h5>Results</h5>
            <p>
                    The experimental setup and tracking algorithm were able to track all movements 
                    successfully for the quality of the camera – with 30 fps (vs 120 fps used for 
                    previous experiments). Although manipulating the lighting was a difficult process, 
                    the new setup with the color-coding allowed for much more robust tracking. Overall, 
                    I was able to obtain a very clean set of data with positions, orientations, and servo 
                    angles for each smarticle tracked over time.
