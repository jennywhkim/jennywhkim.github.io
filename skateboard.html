                            For my mechanical engineering capstone, I'm working in a team of 
                            undergraduate and graduate students to design and build a robot that can perform 
                            skateboarding tricks on a half-pipe. I have been working on the mechanical 
                            design and the power-level systems of the robot. Currently, we are finalizing 
                            the design of the robot and entering the building phase. This has been a great 
                            way to wrap up my undergrad courses in engineering in mechanical analysis, manufacturing, 
                            and mechatronics.

            <h5>Background</h5>
            <p>Our team was tasked with designing and building a 2-DOF robot that 
                could perform three skateboarding tricks: drop-in, stall, and 
                manual. As the drop-in and stall tricks are done together on a 
                half-pipe, this also involved "pumping", where a skateboarder lowers 
                their center of gravity on the way down the half-pipe to maximize gravitational 
                potential energy, like this:
            </p>

            <p>
                This gif is not on a half-pipe, but the skateboarder above pumps in the same way. After a skateboarder 
                drops in from one end of the half-pipe, they would pump on the way down to gain kinetic 
                energy, and use that extra energy to help them get to the other lip to stall, where they briefly 
                shift their center of mass towards the back to hang on to the lip for a second.

            <h5>Overall Structure</h5>
            <p>
                After researching these skateboarding tricks, we were able to establish that virtually all 
                skateboarding tricks could be performed simply by moving the center of mass. We explored 
                various designs that could work with a 10kg-rated children's skateboard: the inverted double 
                pendulum, the "metronome", and the five-bar linkage, among many others.
            </p>
            <img src="prjmedia/skbrainstorm.jpg" id="long">
            <p>
                Due to the range of motion required by some tricks, in addition to the relative simplicity in the 
                mechanical design and control, we ultimately decided to use the inverted double pendulum as our 
                design.
            </p>
            <h5>Motor, Transmission, and Amplifier Selection</h5>
            <p>
                We found the pumping stage to be when our peak acceleration and hence our peak torque for our 
                motors occurred. Since our end-effector was to heavily affect the center of mass, we decided to 
                mount our motors, amplifiers and all other heavy components at the top of the double pendulum. 
                During our research process we found that pumping is performed mostly to compensate for the energy 
                lost due to friction. We experimentally found the friction coefficient of our skateboard and used 
                the dimensions of the half-pipe to calculate how high our robot had to raise the end 
                effector by in how much time. We used this velocity to calculate our necessary power and RPM, and 
                used a velocity-time curve to determine our peak acceleration -- which, in conjunction with other 
                determined masses and lengths helped us find peak torques for both motors.<br>
                <img src="prjmedia/pumping.jpg">
                This was a rather iterative process, as we could not choose our motors and amplifiers without 
                determining the desired end-effector mass, and vice versa. Eventually we determined that our end-effector 
                mass was 4kg, which helped select our motors, transmission, and amplifiers. Due to the high torque requirement and 
                small width requirement of our robot, we decided on belt drives for both our pendulum arms.
            </p>
            <h5>Mechanical Design</h5>
            <p>
                The biggest challenge in our mechanical design process has been in keeping our robot as compact as 
                possible width-wise. The skateboard is only 15cm wide, and going beyond that width would mean risking the safety of 
                our components, especially in the testing phase. One key feature of our design is in mounting our motors at the top of our 
                robot in order to increase the mass at our end-effector and decrease mass on the skateboard itself. In doing 
                so, we used a 9:1 belt drive system for our bottom "shoulder" joint and a 4:1 belt drive for our upper "elbow" 
                joint.<br>
