                            As part of my summer work for SuperCDMS (Cryogenic Dark Matter Search) in the Figueroa Lab, I worked on PCB 
                            and electronics fixture design for the cryogenic equipment in the new testing facility at 
                            Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory. I designed PCBs for the cold electronics stages (4K and below). Aside from 
                            these projects, I also worked on magnetic field analysis for the equipment using COMSOL Multiphysics.

            <h5>SuperCDMS Experiment</h5>
            <p>The team at Northwestern for the research project (SuperCDMS) I was working with was in the process 
                of building a completely new underground facility at Fermilab for dark matter detection. SuperCDMS 
                takes a TES (transition-edge sensor) approach to the dark matter search – when the TES/detector reaches 
                45 mK, it is superconducting and can detect any small change in temperature, which is ideal for 
                detecting dark matter. The equipment is composed of cans, arranged like a Russian doll, where 
                each layer, or temperature stage, inside is colder.
                To detect such a small amount of energy at such low temperatures, the PCBs  
                had to minimize parasitic resistances and/or be superconducting.
            </p>
            <img src="prjmedia/fermilab.jpg">
            <p>
                My role in the project was to design the PCBs at various temperature stages of the cryogenic 
                equipment (also called “the fridge”) as well as to recreate the SQUID box, a box made of Cryoperm 
                to hold and shield an array of sensitive magnetometer chips, which are shown below.

            <h5>PCB Designs</h5>
            <p>
                One of the PCBs I drew for this project was the PCB at the 4K temperature stage, which simply 
                allowed for 3 MDM cables to go through the layer, in addition to measuring the temperature at the 
                stage. The MDM cables eventually to detectors, arrays of magnetometers called SQUID arrays, or 
                thermometers for the different temperature stages. 
            </p>
            <img src="prjmedia/4K.jpg">
            <p>
                Another PCB I drew for this project was the PCB at the mixing chamber stage (one stage colder 
                than the 4K stage, around 1K) that brought the SQUID array and thermometers to the MDM connectors. 
                The main requirement for this PCB design was minimal parasitic resistance due to magnetic field. 
                Due to the precision required for the detection, all loops in the circuit had to be drawn as 
                closely as possible on either side of the board to avoid producing magnetic fields, which would 
                lead to parasitic resistances.
            </p>

            <h5>SQUID Mounting CAD</h5>
            <p>
                In addition to the PCB designs above, I also put together a mounting system for SQUIDs. Each SQUID
                was attached to a PCB, which I also drew. The mounting system consisted of an array of PCBs 
                with two combs, Spira-Shield (pictured left) for gasketing, an inner metal sleeve, and a recreated 
                outer sleeve (originally from <a href="https://www.nist.gov/" target="_blank">NIST</a>) with Cryoperm, a material for 
                magnetic shielding.<br><br>
                The PCB for each SQUID was drawn as a 4-layer PCB with exposed surfaces of copper to solder and allow 
                for superconduction. Vias (holes lined with solder) were placed around each track for additional magnetic 
                shielding.

            <h5>Other Fixtures</h5>
            <p>
                During my time at the Figueroa Lab, I also worked on a number of other simple mechanical fixtures. One of them 
                was a wirebonding fixture I designed to help wirebond both sides of the detector:
            </p>
            <img src="prjmedia/wirebonding.jpg" id="long">
            <p>
                Because working with the detectors is a delicate process, there is a cutout in the middle to ensure that 
                a wirebonded portion of the detector will not touch the worktable while wirebonding the other side. Additionally, 
                spaces for hex heads are provided to mount the detectors to the fixture stably while wire-bonding.
            </p>
