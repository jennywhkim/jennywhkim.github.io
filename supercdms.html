                            As part of my summer work for SuperCDMS (Cryogenic Dark Matter Search) in the Figueroa Lab, I worked on PCB 
                            and electronics fixture design for the cryogenic equipment in the new testing facility at 
                            Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory. I designed PCBs for the cold electronics stages (4K and below). Aside from 
                            these projects, I also worked on magnetic field analysis for the equipment using COMSOL Multiphysics.

            <h5>Background</h5>
            <p>The team at Northwestern for the research project (SuperCDMS) I was working with was in the process 
                of building a completely new underground facility at Fermilab for dark matter detection. SuperCDMS 
                takes a TES (transition-edge sensor) approach to the dark matter search â€“ when the TES/detector reaches 
                45 mK, it is superconducting and can detect any small change in temperature, which is ideal for 
                detecting dark matter. The equipment is composed of cans, arranged like a Russian doll, where 
                each layer, or temperature stage, inside is colder.
                To detect such a small amount of energy at such low temperatures, the PCBs  
                had to minimize parasitic resistances and/or be superconducting.
