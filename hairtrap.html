                            For one of my Segal Design Certificate classes, my teammates and I worked on a white-space project. 
                            We explored the difficulty in long, tangled hair clinging to walls and drains in showers. After 
                            research, brainstorming, and an iterative brainstorming process, we developed a brush that would help 
                            collect tangled hair and dispose of it quickly in an environmentally friendly way without having to 
                            touch it.

            <h5>Goal</h5>
            <p>
                To develop an easy, clean, environmentally friendly, and durable solution to allow people with long hair 
                or living with long-haired housemates to remove hair off their walls and their hands after showering.
            </p>

            <h5>Research</h5>
            <p>
                This white-space project was created for a human-centered product design class. As a team of 
                all girls living in shared spaces, we noticed that shower cleanliness, especially with hair, was 
                an issue in girls’ shared bathrooms. We asked Northwestern students in a survey about their current 
                solutions and analyzed the effectiveness of each solution using the following factors:
            </p>
            <img src="prjmedia/hairexistingsols.png">
            <p>
                From this, we were also able to identify a gap in current solutions: many people combed through their hair 
                while showering, and didn't have an easy method to remove hair from their hands.
            </p>

            <h5>Problem Definition</h5>
            <p>
                To get a better, detailed understanding of our problem, we journey mapped the experience of a woman 
                with long hair showering in a shared bathroom. This journey map allowed us to find various pain points 
                in showering. We were eventually able to narrow our problem down to cleaning hair specifically, and to 
                break down potential solutions into 3 categories.
            </p>

            <h5>Iterative Prototyping and Testing</h5>
            <p>
                After analyzing advantages of existing solutions and testing mockups, we were able to narrow down our 
                design to one concept: a brush that could be retracted to remove hair easily into a trash can. As we explored 
                mechanisms to achieve this, we learned from users and our own testing that a squeeze mechanism was most inutitive.
                <br><br>
                For the brush aspect of our design, we prototyped different types of bristles using a multi-material 3D printer. 
                Bristles of different levels of 3 factors were tested. Each “test square” contained bristles of different levels 
                of material (soft/hard), spacing (wide/narrow), and shape (cylinder/cone). We tested each combination to observe how 
                each factor affected others.
            </p>
            <img src="prjmedia/bristles.jpg">
            <p>
                Our team was able to quickly eliminate wide-spaced bristles as they did not pick up any hair, 
                and was able to narrow the solution down to different combinations of bristles material and shape. 
                We eventually determined that the cylinder-shaped bristles of hard material were best at collecting 
                hair from walls, while the users preferred cleaning hair off their hands with the cone-shaped bristles 
                of hard material.
            </p>
            <img src="prjmedia/bristledoe.png">
            <h5>Final Prototype</h5>
            <p>
                Our final prototype involved a simple squeeze mechanism for the user to release hair. 
                It used 2 springs for the mechanism, requiring minimal force to squeeze and dispense of the hair. 
                The bristles were a combination of cylinder and cone-shaped bristles to encourage users to both 
                clean the shower walls (with the cylindrical bristles) as well as wipe hair off their hands onto 
                the bristles (with the cone-shaped bristles).<br><br>
                To print the inner bristled portion of our prototype (white), we used the multi-material Connex 
                printer to 3D print the prototype of different materials in different parts. We originally took 
                the CAD file for the outer meshed portion using an FDM printer, but with issues with 
                warping and mesh tolerance, moved towards laser cutting acrylic.
