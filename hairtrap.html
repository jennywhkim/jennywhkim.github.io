                            For one of my Segal Design Certificate classes, my teammates and I worked on a white-space project. 
                            We explored the difficulty in long, tangled hair clinging to walls and drains in showers. After 
                            research, brainstorming, and an iterative brainstorming process, we developed a brush that would help 
                            collect tangled hair and dispose of it quickly in an environmentally friendly way without having to 
                            touch it.

            <h5>Goal</h5>
            <p>
                To develop an easy, clean, environmentally friendly, and durable solution to allow people with long hair 
                or living with long-haired housemates to remove hair off their walls and their hands after showering.

            <h5>Research</h5>
            <p>
                This white-space project was created for a human-centered product design class. As a team of 
                all girls living in shared spaces, we noticed that shower cleanliness, especially with hair, was 
                an issue in girlsâ€™ shared bathrooms. We asked Northwestern students in a survey about their current 
                solutions and analyzed the effectiveness of each solution using the following factors:
