                <td><p> I'm Jenny, an engineer with an affinity for design and problem solving. 
                        I love to collaborate with different people to develop solutions that will help make 
                        peopleâ€™s lives easier, safer, and more enjoyable. Part of that comes from my international background &#8212; 
                        I've lived in 5 countries (and 8 cities!) so far, all of which have been eye-opening experiences and allowed 
                        me to appreciate diversity.</br></br>
                        Currently, I'm a senior at Northwestern University studying <em>Mechanical Engineering</em> 
                        and pursuing the <em>Segal Design Certificate</em> (graduating in June 2020). 
                        Outside of class, I'm also a stage manager for the <a href= "https://www.nudm.org/" target="_blank"> Northwestern 
                            University Dance Marathon</a>, which is one of the largest student-run philanthropies in the country. </br></br>
                        When I'm not working on an engineering project or helping run a 30-hour 
                        dance marathon, I can be found travelling the world, hiking, 
                        cooking, or playing the violin.</br></br>
