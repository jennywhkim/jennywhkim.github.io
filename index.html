        <h1>Hi! I'm Jenny.</h1>
        <h3>I'm a mechanical engineer passionate about human-centered design.</h3>
        <br/>

        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p> I'm Jenny, an engineer with an affinity for design and problem solving. 
            I love to collaborate with different people to develop solutions that will help make 
            peopleâ€™s lives easier, safer, and more enjoyable, regardless of ability, condition, or 
            socioeconomic background. Part of that comes from my international background &#8212; 
            I've lived in 5 countries (and 8 cities!) so far, all of which have been eye-opening experiences and allowed 
            me to appreciate diversity.</br></br>
            Currently, I'm a senior at Northwestern University studying Mechanical Engineering 
            and pursuing the Segal Design Certificate (graduating in June 2020). 
            Outside of class, I'm also a stage manager for the <a href= "https://www.nudm.org/" target="_blank"> Northwestern 
                University Dance Marathon</a>, which is one of the largest student-run philanthropies in the country. </br></br>
            When I'm not working on an engineering project or helping run a 30-hour 
            dance marathon, I can be found travelling the world, hiking, 
            cooking, or playing the violin!</br></br>
