        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>I'm a senior at Northwestern University studying Mechanical Engineering and Design. 
            I love to collaborate with different people to develop solutions that not only function,
             but will help make peopleâ€™s lives easier, safer, and more enjoyable. </p>
             <br/><p>On campus, I'm a stage manager for the <a href= "https://www.nudm.org/">Northwestern University Dance Marathon.</a></p>
