        <h1>Hi! I'm Jenny.</h1>
        <h3>I'm a mechanical engineer and designer.</h3>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p> I love to collaborate with different people to develop solutions that will help make 
            peopleâ€™s lives easier, safer, and more enjoyable. </br>
            Currently, I'm a senior at Northwestern University studying <em>Mechanical Engineering</em> 
            and pursuing the <em>Segal Design Certificate</em>. I'm also 
            a stage manager for the <a href= "https://www.nudm.org/"> Northwestern 
                University Dance Marathon</a>. </br>
            When I'm not working on a design project or helping run a 30-hour 
            dance marathon, I can be found travelling to new cities and countries, hiking, 
            cooking, or playing my violin!
