                <td><p> I'm Jenny, an engineer with an affinity for design and problem solving. 
                        I love to collaborate with different people to develop solutions that will help make 
                        life easier, safer, and more enjoyable for people around the world. Part of that comes from my international background &#8212; 
                        I've lived in 5 countries so far, all of which have been eye-opening 
                        experiences. In fact, right now I'm working with an organic co-op in Thailand for a 
                        design project!</br></br>
                        Currently, I'm a senior at Northwestern University studying <em>Mechanical Engineering</em> 
                        and pursuing the <em>Segal Design Certificate</em> (graduating in June 2020). 
                        Outside of class, I'm also a stage manager for the <a href= "https://www.nudm.org/" target="_blank"> Northwestern 
                            University Dance Marathon</a>. </br></br>
                        In my free time, I love to travel the world, hike, 
                        cook, or play the violin.</br></br>
